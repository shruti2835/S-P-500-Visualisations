# S-P-500-Visualisations

This is a simple PowerBI report of S&P 500 Companies. The dataset for this report is taken from Kaggle. I have used different visualizations like the pie chart, donut chart, bar graph for visualising the data and analysing the results. I have uploaded the PowerBI report and also some .png images of my visualisations.
